<h1>WooCommerce Talk Notes</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Gabe, F-Stop Design, twitter, etc. I primarily do WordPress development, using WordPress to build websites for my clients. I do custom theming, which for me means I take a blank starter theme like Underscores or Bones, plug my own design into it, and customize it, both on the front end and in the admin area, to suit the project . </p>

<p>I'm going to talk about WooCommerce, which is a fully featured e-commerce plugin for WordPress that allows you to quickly get up and running with an online shop.</p>

<p>I'm in the final stages of an e-commerce project built on WooCommerce. The website I'm building is based a custom WordPress theme (of course), and I've had to get pretty deep into the inner workings of WooCommerce to get things looking and working the way the client and I need them to, so I thought I'd share some of my experiences.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>WooCommerce a <a href="link to github repo">free, open source plugin</a> with <a href="link to add ons page">premium add ons</a>. So that's how they make their money. We as WordPress users are used to a lot  of nice tools being free, but good things do tend to cost money, especially with something as complex as e-commerce.</p>

<p>The fact that you can get the fully functioning plugin for free get everything set up, see how it works with your theme etc is a great argument for the free plugin/premium add ons model.</p>

<p>The interface and features are well thought out.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Easy setup*
<ul><li>asterix: very easy if your theme has WooCommerce support, a bit more complicated if it doesn't. I'll get to that in a minute, but for now let's take a look at some key features</li>
<li>demo admin area</li>
<li>show pages auto created</li></ul></li>
<li>Everything is there for adding &amp; managing products
<ul><li>demo add product</li>
<li>Simple vs Variable
<ul><li>demo creating variations</li>
<li>demo complex variations</li></ul></li>
<li>Images
<ul><li>featured</li>
<li>gallery</li></ul></li>
<li>checkout</li>
<li>widgets</li></ul></li>
<li>*Adding theme support
<ul><li>if your theme does not have WooCommerce support, you will need to add some code to the theme's functions.php file, or wherever you prefer to have your includes.</li>
<li>WooCommerce walks you through what's needed.</li>
<li>basically you're just telling WooCommerce where the content area of your theme is in the markup, so it knows how to fit into your theme</li>
<li>Echo html structure of theme's page.php</li></ul></li>
<li>Supports Twentytwelve</li>
<li><p>WooThemes</p>

<h2>Customization</h2></li>
<li><p>As soon as you want to do something that is not in the default setup, things get more complicated</p></li>
<li>Most templates can be overridden buy copying files from ~/wp-content/plugins/woo-commerce/templates/ to /wp-content/themes/your-theme/woocommerce/
<ul><li>example...</li></ul></li>
<li>Not all things can be changed by overriding templates, because they are built with "hooks" within the plugin core. But even these can be tweaked.
<ul><li>Find the action that activates the feature that you want to edit</li>
<li>use <code>remove-action()</code> to "unhook" the default woocommerce action</li>
<li>use <code>add-action()</code> to "rehook" an action of your own.</li>
<li>example..
<ul><li>Use code search tool to find the action I needed to customize within the plugin</li>
<li>copy the action code into my theme include file</li>
<li>unhook the WooCommerce action with <code>remove-action</code></li>
<li>hook mine up with <code>add-action</code></li>
<li>edit my copy to do what I want it to do
